# HomeWork-2-Portfolio: Advanced CSS

## HW 2 Description
This webpage was created with the intention of informing a prospective employer about who I am, my skill sets, and my areas of interest, which are:
- JS Projects 
- EdTech tools
- Personal "for fun" full-stack projects

### The navigation bar:
- Intended to link to 4 functions within the website below.
- This website was created to be a store of information and showcase my professional aptitudes.
### The coding:
- This html and css file created a clear semantic structure that is easy for a user to follow as well as inspect the script. 
- Through this activity I learned how to properly organize an html and css file to make it easy for the end user to understand. As well as GitHub best practices.
### Responsive Web Design:
- The website is fully responsive to a variety of screen sizes.
- Additionally, When the webpage is viewed on a small enough window, the layout is modified to stack the div's instead of having them side by side.
